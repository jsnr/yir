Aided by constantly improving technology and gear, today’s adventurers continue to define the unknown, from climbing virgin peaks in Antarctica’s Queen Maud Land to descending into a lava lake in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to embarking on a 21,000-mile odyssey in the footsteps of humankind.</span>  </p></li><li><p class="info-headline">Out of Africa</p><p class="info-summary">The phrase “epic journey” gets used a lot, but it’s usually an exaggeration. This time it’s an understatement. Earlier this year Paul Salopek (seen here in Ethiopia’s Afar desert) embarked on a seven-year global trek, walking from Africa to Tierra del Fuego in the footsteps of our ancestors. Why? “For many reasons,” he writes in the December issue of <em>National Geographic</em>. “[T]o relearn the contours of our planet at the human pace of three miles an hour. To slow down. To think. To write. To render current events as a form of pilgrimage. I hope to repair certain important connections burned through by artificial speed, by inattentiveness. I walk, as everyone does, to see what lies ahead. I walk to remember.”

It’s important for waterfall kayakers to land precisely, an outcome influenced by their actions at the lip of the waterfall and into the first 20 feet of free fall. “At this moment,” explained Brandt, “I was focused on setting my angle correctly.” <span class="info-credit">Photograph by Tim Kemple  </span><a href="http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/extreme-photo-of-the-week/" target="_blank" class="info-link">

As National Geographic Daily News reported in May, some aviation historians now believe a German-born inventor named Gustave Whitehead—seen here with his daughter Rose—beat the brothers into the air by as much as three years. Though many experts disagree or remain dubious, an Australian flight historian named John Brown has convinced the aviation bible <em>Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft</em> that an enhanced photograph shows Whitehead flying his plane in Fairfield, Connecticut, on August 14, 1901. Which way this piece of history tilts remains up in the air.

Today loose regulations and a boom in commercial climbing have made the 29,035-foot-tall Mount Everest accessible to anyone who can afford to pay the price. As hundreds of people try to climb it every year—and more than half succeed, as this graphic shows—the peak is being ruined with garbage and waste. At the same time, say professional climbers, the experience itself is being ruined by the glut of visitors. “The most dangerous thing about Everest,” says one guide, “is everyone else who’s trying to climb it.” Mark Jenkins’s story in the June issue of <em>National Geographic</em> examines how Everest has become an icon of everything that’s wrong with climbing.

To showcase it, we developed Zero to 60, a weekly video series that celebrates the beauty, athleticism, and humor of outdoor adventure and exploration. Each 60-second cinematic episode features world-class adventurers in action, such as climber Alex Honnold deep-water soloing in Oman, kayaker Tyler Bradt hunting for the perfect waterfall in Mexico, and photographer Jimmy Chin ski mountaineering in the Grand Tetons.

Another way is to watch this accompanying video, which offers an up-close look at the cold hostility of Queen Maud Land and the unique challenges faced by these devoted climbers. As photographer Cory Richards says: “You definitely have to work for everything in Antarctica. Nothing is a given; you have to earn it.”

For geothermal scientist and National Geographic grantee Andrés Ruzo, being boiled alive is a distinct possibility. While standing at the edge of a scalding hot river in Peru—water temperatures can reach 210°F—Ruzo was suddenly engulfed in a rainstorm. “It was like a curtain rising: The temperature differential between the rain and the river caused a whiteout. I couldn’t see, but I whistled to let my partner know I was OK,” he says.  “At 130°F flesh cooks. My eyes would have cooked in less than a minute, and I couldn’t have seen how to get out. I’d seen rats and an opossum fall in, their eyes turning milky white. I kept whistling.”<span class="info-credit">Illustration by Istvan Banyai, National Geographic</span>  <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/125/risk-taking/survival-guides/ruzo-boiling-point/" target="_blank" class="info-link">

<li><p class="info-headline">Famous Failures</p><p class="info-summary">Where would we be without failure? Hannah Bloch takes up this existential question in the September issue of <em>National Geographic</em>, examining the necessary flip side of success. “Failure,” writes Bloch, “is the specter that hovers over every attempt at exploration. Yet without the sting of failure to spur us to reassess and rethink, progress would be impossible.” Famous failures abound, including that of explorer Robert Peary, seen here in 1909 peering over Arctic ice on his third try to reach the North Pole. “Even at their most miserable,” writes Bloch, “failures provide information to help us do things differently next time." <span class="info-credit">Photograph by Robert E.

By one estimate, more than 99 percent of Afghanistan’s archaeological sites have been looted, items stolen by farmers enriched by the high value of rare antiquities.

</p><p class="info-summary">In June, archeologists uncovered the first unlooted royal tomb from the Wari civilization. The ancient people are often overshadowed by their historic successors, the Inca, but the Wari built South America’s earliest empire in modern-day Peru between 700 and 1000. The high quality of Wari artwork has long attracted international attention, to the point that a pair of wooden ear ornaments with global frontal discs were a big hit for archeologists—and readers of National Geographic Daily News.

</p><p class="info-summary">A few years ago Lee Berger shook up the paleontological world with a discovery: two complete skeletons of a new hominid species, which he named <em>Australopithecus sediba.</em> He shook up the field even more by publishing quickly: Within 18 months his data was accessible to other paleontologists. Now, after three weeks of excavations in a South African cave, he’s brought to light hundreds of new fossil specimens. He’s also launched a worldwide Facebook search for qualified spelunker-scientists, to help him study the fossils and publish the results within a year. And he’s publicly chronicling the excavations as they happen—via live tweeting, daily blogs, and videos from the site—in hopes of making his open-access policy the new norm in a famously secretive field.

Four centuries after Shakespeare wrote about the king, National Geographic Daily News reported on how the king’s bones were found and thoroughly analyzed. Earlier this year, English archaeologists declared there was virtually no doubt that the body—found beneath a British parking lot—belonged to the former king.

About 5,300 years ago, a man wandered into the Ötztal Alps near the present-day border of Italy and Austria and was killed. Fortunately for archaeologists and anthropologists, the icy conditions preserved him extremely well—so well that five millennia later, he’s still being analyzed in an Italian lab for clues about human origins and evolution. In October, National Geographic’s Onward team visited Ötzi and the site where he died.

For decades industrial pollutants—insecticides, fungicides, organochlorides, and DDT—leached into rivers there, and by the late 1970s the British otter population had all but collapsed. The mammals also went extinct in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and in most of France, Germany, and Italy as well. But as chemical bans slowly took effect, writes Adam Nicolson in the February issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, “the population started to climb back toward health.” By 2010 nearly 60 percent of English riverbanks were occupied by otters. Today “only the London area and some northern industrial cities remain otter-free.”

But if you really want to get up close and personal with the Vumbi pride, dip into this interactive online feature. Photographer Michael “Nick” Nichols and videographer Nathan Williamson made several extended trips to the Serengeti between July 2011 and January 2013. Using high-tech tools—cameras mounted on a remote-control toy car and a rugged robot tank, night-vision cameras and goggles—as well as old-fashioned, camera-in-hand technology, Nichols shot 242,000 images (including this one of a male named C-Boy mating with a female in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park), and Williamson recorded 200 hours of video. The result is a multimedia presentation you have to see—and hear—to believe.

</p><p class="info-summary">“Cassowaries are large, flightless birds related to emus and (more distantly) to ostriches, rheas, and kiwis,” writes Olivia Judson in the September issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine. How large? People-size: Adult males stand well over five foot five and top 110 pounds. Females are even taller, and can weigh more than 160 pounds. Dangerous when roused, they’re shy and peaceable when left alone. But even birds this big and tough are prey to habitat loss. The dense New Guinea and Australia rain forests where they live have dwindled. Today cassowaries might number 1,500 to 2,000. And because they help shape those same forests—by moving seeds from one place to another—“if they vanish,” Judson writes, “the structure of the forest would gradually change” too. <span class="info-credit">Photograph by Christian Ziegler</span><a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/cassowaries/judson-text" target="_blank" class="info-link">

But that splendid isolation, writes Hampton Sides in the May issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, “has led to an astonishing abundance of life,” past and present. Paleontologists say it’s the last place where woolly mammoths lived. Today it’s home to snowy owls, muskoxen, arctic foxes (like this pup playing with a lemming carcass), reindeers, and the largest population of Pacific walruses. It also serves as the world’s biggest denning ground for polar bears. This photo gallery of its current residents merely flicks at the island’s biodiversity.

Their numbers dropped alarmingly.” But “a Brazilian government crackdown on poaching and a 1992 global ban on the trade of wild crocodilian skins eased the pressure on the beleaguered yacare population. The crocs themselves did the rest. After a string of intense rainy seasons—ideal for breeding—caiman numbers rebounded dramatically. As many as ten million yacare caimans are estimated to live in the wetlands today.”

First formally described by scientists in 1953, the species seemingly vanished several years later, according to an October 8 National Geographic News article. “For 40 years, no one saw it,” says Jonathan Losos, an evolutionary biologist and herpetologist at Harvard University who has studied the animal. “At that point, we thought the species had gone extinct.” But then, in 2005 a group of bird-watchers near Mindo, Ecuador, spotted one of the strange lizards walking across the road. After sharing the picture when they returned home, reptile researchers soon learned that the Pinocchio lizard was indeed still alive. Subsequent expeditions have been sent to study the lizard in the wild.

</p><p class="info-summary">
In 1990, Jaroslav Flegr learned he was infected with <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, a parasite that lives and reproduces in cats. When the Czech evolutionary biologist learned more about how the parasite moves from host to host, he risked his reputation on a hunch his colleagues called crazy: Toxo might be controlling his brain, as it does animals, making him more reckless. Turns out he was right. <br /><br />
A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, <em>National Geographic </em> ran a yearlong series profiling explorers who take risks for the benefit of others.

Scientists working with a related species in Japan point to genetics over environmental factors. Meantime, recent mating trials in New Orleans have posited green as a recessive trait—good camouflage just makes them fittest for survival. Meaning it’s easier being green.

The killing is substantially indiscriminate, with heavy impact on species already battered by destruction or fragmentation of their breeding habitat. Mediterraneans shoot cranes, storks, and large raptors for which governments to the north have multimillion-euro conservation projects. All across Europe bird populations are in steep decline, and the slaughter in the Mediterranean is one of the causes.” Franzen’s eye-opening article is accompanied by David Guttenfelder’s affecting photographs. In this one, a songbird rescuer in Cyprus uses his saliva to remove sticky plum tree sap from a blackcap’s feather and feet, so that the bird can safely fly when released.

But today more and more people are of mixed heritage. In the 2000 census, when a multiple-race option appeared for the first time, 6.8 million Americans checked it off. Ten years later that number grew by 32 percent. The quickly changing fabric of our country—where familiar racial categories are being joined by new ones rooted in self-determined identity—provides an opportunity to re-examine our definitions and assumptions. It’s also a chance to gaze at a gallery of intriguing faces and features, photographed by Martin Schoeller.

</p><p class="info-summary">Libya has been a recent flashpoint of global conflict and foreign policy debate. In 2011 civil war engulfed the North African country, prompting a NATO-led military intervention that ended Muammar Qaddafi’s life and long dictatorship. In 2013, Robert Draper’s February cover story in <em>National Geographic</em> magazine looked at how Qaddafi’s “warped vision” and “tangled philosophy” twisted Libya’s connection to its own rich history, neglecting cultural and archaeological treasures from Cyrene in the east to Sabratah in the west. Yet the story also looked forward, optimistically, to a post-conflict country and the challenge its citizens face in forging a new identity (re)attached to their past.

Even pre–high school students feel pressure to physically alter themselves in pursuit of a fantasy ideal. Photographer and artist Ji Yeo’s Beauty Recovery Room project visualizes this disturbing cultural trend in an October post from PROOF. Yeo describes her series as using “the wounded faces and bodies of women who have recently undergone plastic surgery to show the physical cost of social pressure in Korea. Going under the knife, enduring bruises, scars, and being under general anesthetic several times are no longer considered risky or extravagant. They have all had multiple procedures and have plans for future augmentation.”

Once upon a time you needed talent, training, and technical savvy to take a great picture, plus high-end equipment and the money to buy it. Today all you need is a smart phone with a camera app. People are taking—and sharing, and saving—more photos than they ever have before. It’s a revolution both aesthetic (filters make saturation and faux-vintage tones easy) and political (democratizing photography can encourage actual democracy, as citizen journalists in Tehran and Taksim Square showed). As these pictures—shots of everyday life in Africa, on an Instagram feed—make clear, the digital age is creating a world simultaneously bigger and smaller.

Lale Labuko doesn’t know when he was born—his tribe in Ethiopia’s Omo Valley doesn’t keep written records—but he does know he has to stop an ancient local custom: killing babies believed to be cursed. So far he’s rescued 37 children, ages one to eleven. Today they live in a home he built with the help of photographer and filmmaker John Rowe, co-founder of Labuko’s Omo Child organization. <br /><br />
A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, <em>National Geographic </em> ran a yearlong series profiling explorers who take risks for the benefit of others.

But photographer Jessica Hilltout had other ideas. “The Belgium-based photographer set out to see what soccer looked like far from the bright lights and big stadiums,” writes Jeremy Berlin in the February issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine. “What she found—over seven months, ten countries, and 12,500 miles—was a grassroots game where passion trumped poverty, a do-it-yourself ethic prospered, and one ball could ‘bring happiness to an entire village.’” Hilltout kept a journal of the improvised soccer balls she came across, while making a promise to herself to return to these villages with proper equipment.

From the beginning of December till Easter, festivals across the continent celebrate harvests and solstices, rites of passage and superstitions. Though most are tied to Christian holidays, many feature pre-Christian rituals—a “tribal Europe” where men cavort in costumes that blur the lines separating human and animal, civilization and wilderness, death and rebirth. A gallery of Charles Fréger’s photographs, from a story in the April <em>National Geographic</em>, show how these wild men, in full regalia, represent the complicated relationship human communities still have with nature.

By releasing carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, we have warmed the Earth by more than a full degree Fahrenheit over the past century and raised sea level by about eight inches. … [S]cientists are still uncertain about how fast and how high seas will rise.” <!--This chart shows NOAA’s four possible scenarios for the year 2100. -->

</p><p class="info-summary">



For nearly 40 years Lonnie Thompson has climbed to mountaintop glaciers and retrieved climate data from deep inside the ice. Some say Thompson has spent more time above 18,000 feet than anyone alive. His data show the planet is warming at a historic rate—meaning his vital, dangerous work is taking on new urgency. 

<br /><br />
A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, <em>National Geographic </em> ran a yearlong series profiling explorers who take risks for the benefit of others.

Once upon a time they were found in aerosol propellants, refrigerants, foams, and other industrial processes. But in the late 1980s the Montreal Protocol was enacted, phasing out CDCs and other ozone-damaging substances. By the late 1990s CFC production had all but stopped, making modern spray cans ozone-safe. Though scientists say the ozone layer won’t return to pre-1980s levels till after 2050, the amount of CFC in the atmosphere is steadily waning. It’s a start.

</p><p class="info-summary">The renowned storm chaser Tim Samaras died on May 31, at age 55, when he was overtaken by a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. The monstrous twister—at 2.6 miles, the widest ever recorded—also claimed the lives of Tim’s 24-year-old son, Paul, and Carl Young, 45, their colleague at TWISTEX, the Denver-based field research team Samaras founded. A multimedia time line—featuring interviews, video footage, maps, and more—takes you through Samaras’s final 40 minutes, from a variety of perspectives.

</p><p class="info-summary">The research community lost one of their own when storm chaser—and National Geographic explorer—Tim Samaras perished in a tornado that hit El Reno, Oklahoma, on May 31. The United States is hit with more tornados than anywhere else in the world, including Australia, India, and the United Kingdom. America’s unique topography and climate spawn more than a thousand twisters a year. At once beautiful and terrifying, the video at the link below shows tornadoes that have hit the U.S. from 1950 to 2013. It was published as part of a <em>National Geographic</em> magazine package on Samaras in November.

In the October issue of <em>National Geographic</em>, writer Jeffrey Gettleman and photographer Ed Kashi reported on the bloody business of conflict minerals—and on whether a budding campaign to stop companies from using ill-gotten resources will make a difference.

Cataloging the discarded possessions of migrants is “archaeology of ten minutes ago,” De León says in a June posting by Virginia Hughes in National Geographic’s Phenomena blog. Her story helps flesh out De León’s Undocumented Migration Project, for which he has interviewed hundreds of desperate border crossers.

</p><p class="info-summary">Living to 100 used to be a rare mark of longevity. It still is, but the advanced age is no longer quite so rare, thanks to a series of genetic changes and research studies that illuminate the maladies of old age and how they might be avoided. The May cover story of <em>National Geographic</em> featured newborn babies likely to live well past 100, and people like Ruby Timms, 85, who are already well on their way.

</p><p class="info-summary">Should extinct species be brought back to life? That was the provocative question asked by the April cover story of <em>National Geographic</em>. As science now makes it possible to recover genetic material from animals that disappeared from the wild, bygone species like the passenger pigeon and the thylacine, a relative of the kangaroo, are candidates for rebirth. But should they be resurrected? Researchers and ethicists continue to debate the effects and wisdom of introducing yesterday’s species into today’s world.

</p><p class="info-summary">Everything in the universe is made of atoms, the foot servants of elements. Only 90 elements are known to exist in nature, but for decades researchers have been working to create more of them. A group of scientists known as element hunters were profiled in the May edition of <em>National Geographic</em>. Their work in research labs is fleeting—some man-made elements only exist for fractions of a second—but the reward of adding a new element to the periodic table is eternal.

National Geographic Daily News reported on a team of Harvard researchers who are learning how to grow new structures in precise shapes and sizes using different combinations of chemicals. They usually start with flowers, which are easy shapes to make. Here, a field of green stems was decorated with thickened flowers. On another test, the scientists created a red rose that looks as though Dr. Seuss imagined it.

</p><p class="info-summary">A Stradivarius is considered the world’s rarest, best violin, dating back to the 18th century. What makes the 600 or so that still exist so special? Wood from when the instruments were made grew during a uniquely cold period: 1645 to 1715. Long winters during that time created low density in the wood, which helps create a richer sound for a violin. Stradivarius violins, named after the family that made them, can’t be re-created. But a Swiss researcher uncovered how to make similar wood that can create an indistinguishable sound. The secret? A fungus that changes how wood grows, detailed in the April edition of <em>National Geographic</em>.

Tim Folger considers the question in the January issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, which kicked off our 125th anniversary year’s theme of exploration. “To get to the stars,” Folger writes, “we’ll need many new materials and engines but also a few of the old intangibles. They haven’t vanished. In fact … in the conversation of certain dreamer-nerds, especially outside NASA, you can now hear echoes of the old aspiration and adventurousness—of the old craziness for space.” That old craziness appears on the cover itself, where Stephan Martiniere’s art shows a 22nd-century dream: an unmanned probe powered by nuclear fusion exploring a new solar system, after traveling several decades from Earth at 100 million miles an hour.

</p><p class="info-summary">Our universe is expanding faster and faster as time ticks forward, and experts blame dark energy. A mysterious force that scientists struggle to find, dark energy makes up about 68 percent of the universe, according to NASA. One of the more recent efforts to pin down this maddeningly elusive part of the universe involves holes—lots and lots of holes. Researchers make perforations in metal plates the size of manhole covers that correspond to the locations of known galaxies. They then slide that plate in front of a telescope’s mirrors. The holes funnel the light from each galaxy into instruments that help scientists map the universe’s structure and motion, which they hope will lead them to dark energy.

</p><p class="info-summary">

Sunita Williams has spent 322 days in space and 50 hours walking out there, the most spacewalking of any female astronaut. A former Navy pilot, she first met astronauts two decades ago during test pilot school—and discovered that she could join them based on her flying experience. Now a 47-year-old astronaut, she says spacewalking is like flying a helicopter with a battle group: You focus on your job but always know where the other guy is.<br /><br />
A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, <em>National Geographic </em> ran a yearlong series profiling explorers who take risks for the benefit of others.

For Les Sapeurs, members of the Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Elégantes (the Society of Tastemakers and Elegant People), their clothes are as much about extravagance as they are about creativity. But beyond being a form of self-expression, it is a lifestyle about poise and propriety. Good manners, attention to detail, visual perfection, and social etiquette are of utmost importance to these gentlemen. Although often spending exorbitant amounts of money on clothes in a country where nearly half the population lives beneath the national poverty line, like all of us, they are striving to carve out their identities in the world, moving beyond class and circumstance.</span>

</p><p class="info-summary">
<span class="summary-credit">Pamela Chen, Senior Photo Editor</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">For our story “Last of the Viking Whalers,” photographer Marcus Bleasdale captured this picture of schoolgirls painting golden streaks on their skin and hair by smearing dandelions on each other after a coming-of-age ceremony on the remote island of Røst, Norway. Some island fishing communities like Røst have become so small that they cannot support a local high school, and parents must send their children to live on the mainland, away from home, to continue their education when they turn 15. These girls here are part of the next generation who must leave the island to continue their schooling.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">At first you don’t even realize how close Marcus must be standing to the girls to compose this image in a way that feels as if you are right there with them. And by doing so, he takes us there at once, to see the stunning natural beauty of the island and the joy of a normal day in one honest, elegant moment. Through this photograph, we understand more about why it is so hard to leave this place altogether. I love that a photograph can celebrate the in-between, and remind us that life happens here, even as it is bittersweet.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p"><span class="summary-credit">Ken Geiger, Deputy Director of Photography</span></span>

<span class="info-summary-p">One of the most amazing stories I’ve seen in the short time I’ve worked here is Nick Nichols’s photo coverage of “The Short Happy Life of a Serengeti Lion,” which ran in the August 2013 issue.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Not only is this image hauntingly beautiful, as are many images in the story, but what makes this image gripping is the moment created by the intensity of the lion’s eyes combined with the intimacy of having the camera on the same level as the lion. Those two factors create such a gripping image that I’ve never tired of seeing it. </span>

<span class="info-summary-p">I also have such an amazing respect for this set of images—they reset the bar for all brilliant wildlife photography. Nick, along with the gift of time on the ground, used and cobbled numerous pieces of technology so that he could capture never before seen images of lions. That kind of dedication to the craft of photography—and using every tool available to tell a story that moves the dial on lion conservation—is a pleasure to behold.</span>

Rain Forest for Sale, January 2013

Sadie Quarrier, Senior Photo Editor</span>
<span class="info-summary-p">One of the most memorable stories I worked on this year was Yasuní National Park (“Rain Forest for Sale”). It was a special story because we conducted a photo blitz, sending five photographers for one month to document every aspect of this Ecuadorian park, from threatened species and isolated tribes to oil drilling and deforestation. They delivered a wealth of visual riches.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Photographers Ivan Kashinsky and Karla Gachet worked together to cover the Waorani people, immersing themselves in the daily lives of the tribe and documenting the impact oil companies have had on their culture.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">This image of Waorani hunters by Ivan stays with me. I love its rawness—both how it was shot and what it portrays. It speaks to the purity of the people, still hunting for food and relatively untouched by the modern world and possessions. The image transports me to another time.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Ivan breaks the rules by putting a person in the middle of the frame and by cutting off half a body. Yet with the angled gun and machete in the foreground, and the hunter in the background giving dimension, the image is arresting.</span>

<li><p class="info-headline">Bringing Them Back to Life, April 2013</p>
<p class="info-summary">
<span class="summary-credit">Kim Hubbard, Senior Photo Editor</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">When you ask a museum for permission to photograph their prized specimen of an extinct species, it’s not always easy to get approval. When you also tell them that you’d like to photograph the species with a technique that requires potassium cyanide to be in close proximity, it’s nearly impossible. Nevertheless, Robb Kendrick persevered, and he came away with my favorite photo of the year.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Robb is known for his tintype photography, a method popular in the 1800s. Also called wet plate collodion, it produces one-of-a-kind images, but requires a darkroom on site for immediate processing of the exposed plates. When Robb and I were assigned a story about resurrecting extinct creatures, we knew this type of photography could work really well with the subject matter.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Our goal was to make the extinct creatures look as alive as possible, as if they’d been photographed during their lifetime. Artist Fernando Baptista created backgrounds appropriate for each species, and we used grasses, branches, and rocks in the foreground to put the animals in an “environment” where they would’ve lived.</span>

<span>I think we succeeded best with the Tasmanian tiger at the American Museum of Natural History. I love this picture not only because it was difficult to produce, but also because it allows you to believe, if only for a moment, that the Tasmanian tiger is still among us. You can almost hear it growl. Maybe someday.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">This picture delivers exactly what I’ve come to expect from National Geographic. We asked Brent Stirton to go off to a distant place and come back with a story about the cost that can arise from humans and lions living near each other. We expected him, like all the great photographers we work with, to bring back a story told economically, convincingly, and memorably. A man lost both arms in a lion attack and now depends on others to bathe him. Brent’s image is touching, shocking, intriguing—and you just can’t wait to read about it.</span>

</p>
<p class="info-summary"><span class="summary-credit">
Todd James, Senior Photo Editor</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">My love for this photograph by Len Jenshel and Diane Cook is more layered than a Viennese pastry. The scene is so sunny and yet so ominous. Tumbleweeds have invaded suburbia! Where are the kids?  Something has gone terribly wrong at the end of this cul-de-sac. A Russian tumbleweed invasion! If you were writing a chapter for a photography text about implied narrative, including this photograph would be a must. </span>


<span class="info-summary-p">But my layer cake of appreciation for this photograph goes much deeper. I first saw Len and Diane’s photographs of the American West more than 20 years ago. They were my introduction to a new generation of color landscape photographers that included Joel Sternfeld, Stephen Shore, Joel Meyerowitz, and Richard Misrach. These photographers were using big cameras to capture big landscapes and reshaping how we think about photography today. Len and Diane’s work shared that sensibility but also offered a subtle <em>wink, wink</em> at times. A stone wall at the edge of the parking lot added a touch of irony to a Monument Valley landscape.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Their sensibility seemed perfectly suited to this science story with a twist. The tumbleweed, a symbol of the American West, turns out to be an invasive species from the Russian steppes.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Of course I knew Len and Diane loved the western landscape but I had no idea about their tumbleweed obsession, which they trace to a 1964 episode of <em>The Outer Limits</em>. In the show, a couple is stranded in the desert and stalked by a bunch of tumbleweeds.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Len and Diane’s photograph of the lonely red wagon surrounded by tumbleweeds sets the scene for this story perfectly. It is also a perfect expression of their lifetime body of work with a wink and a nod to their favorite episode of <em>The Outer Limits</em>.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">I waited 20 years for this photograph, and it is well worth it.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">The truth is that on another day I could have picked a different picture altogether. It didn’t have to be Anastasia Taylor-Lind’s image of a fisherman’s kids floating on the Yangtze. I could have chosen Rena Effendi’s haymaking out of a Bruegel painting, Michael Yamashita’s Suzhou opera singers through the curtain, Matthieu Paley’s Khan with his wife tiny in the snow behind him, Diane Cook and Len Jenshel’s canopy of cherry blossoms, David Guttenfelder’s North Korean performer crying for her nation’s leader, or Jonas Bendiksen’s ancient skier propped up by skis. I love them all. How can you prefer one child over the others?</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">And no offense, Anastasia, but the composition is messy, with that fish balloon overlapping the girl’s knee and giving her body such an odd shape. Why is she grabbing her foot, as the fish swims out of the frame, giving us the eye? But favorite is not the same as best. I suppose I just couldn’t resist such a casually lighthearted moment—the kids fooling around unself-consciously, the brother’s arm around his sister as he sprawls across the boat yelling or singing, her head trustingly on his shoulder. There’s an immediacy that draws us into their intimacy.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">So, go look at all the pictures from 2013 and choose your own favorite—this one’s mine.</span>

Tess Vincent, Photo Coordinator</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Love at first sight. No phenomenon could better describe this image and its effect on me.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">When Nick Nichols’s assignment images started rolling in, I remember my eyes being drawn to this particular one early and often. I felt like the lone patron of a tiny museum, and, somehow, I discovered something new each time I revisited this piece.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">The tale of the Serengeti lion has been one of the most significant stories for me while at National Geographic, and Hildur, pictured here, one of its most compelling protagonists. This still (which is anything but) is a synthesis of beauty and burden, an illustration of the majesty of the Serengeti as well as the hardships of its inhabitants.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">When I first saw it, I felt hypnotized by the grace and movement in front of me; I could almost hear the swish of the grass and feel the rippling sinews of Hildur as he ran a punishing distance from one territory to the next. I wasn’t looking at a photograph; I was in it. And I was swimming in the painterly swirl of the Serengeti as it was brushed by the fading light of dusk.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">As I came to know this story more, though, I wasn’t only seeing Hildur’s streaked mane and primordial power; I was seeing each rib in his cage, each vertebra in his back, the indisputable evidence of an uncertain life on the plains. This image strikingly brings us into the intricate world of lions and all that makes it so extraordinary.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Being a science fiction geek, this picture of a glowing mysterious craft holds natural appeal for me. Though it may look like a fanciful spaceship, the mission of <em>DEEPSEA CHALLENGE</em> is quite real—to reach the deepest part of the ocean. Mark Thiessen’s brooding depiction of James Cameron’s one-man submarine is a perfect way to show this vehicle dedicated to exploring the unknown.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Yet the picture came about quite by accident. During a night test dive, the sub surfaced some distance away from the recovery ship—a situation that took place only once during the expedition. Mark was in the water and realized that the brilliant lights of the ship as it approached to recover the sub would highlight the craft in an exceptionally dramatic way. He quickly swam to the front of the sub and then dove below it, waiting to make this picture, which became the lead to the story.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Pascal Maitre shot this image of Julie Djikley, a street artist in Kinshasa. Julie covered her body with engine oil and wore cans on her breasts as a statement about pollution in our environment created by cars and traffic. On several occasions she carried a gas tank on her back and a steering wheel in her hands, pushing a tiny car made of old cans. In her seminaked state she drew jeers and disapproval from crowds on Kinshasa streets but she continued to walk in silence throughout the city.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Recently her doctor suggested she stop this practice because the oil was entering her body through her skin, our largest organ.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">The image is effective without a caption, the composition both momentary and studied.  I don’t get tired of looking at this photo because there are so many subtle colors and textures worth gazing at. Unable to see her eyes or what she is thinking, her smile communicates peace and purpose. Her body is that of a strong young woman and makes you wonder why she risks her well-being.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Having traveled to Kinshasa twice I keep this image as a reminder of the strength of poor and concerned artists who continue to communicate what is on their minds amid danger and strife in that dense urban African life.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">My favorite photograph of 2013 has to be one of C-boy the lion. I’ve worked with photographer Nick Nichols for 20 years. “The Short Happy Life of the Serengeti Lion” is the 15th story that we’ve collaborated on for the magazine and the one that I have most wanted to do. I love big cats. For me, this image is the culmination of years of research, planning, and advances in photographic technology coming together in a simple yet powerful way. </span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Lions come alive at night. By photographing C-boy in infrared black and white, without intrusive flash, Nick made the most naturalistic images ever of nocturnal lions. His photographs revealed lions as we rarely get to see them—in the dark, attuned to everything happening around them, in their element. When you look at C-boy, you know that you are playing in his world. It was a privilege.</span>

<p class="info-summary"><span class="summary-credit">
Sarah Leen, Director of Photography</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">To take the all too familiar and to show it in an entirely fresh way that has the power to astonish and delight is a true gift. For a story called “Visions on Earth,” published in our October 125th anniversary issue, photographer Abelardo Morell worked his magic to show us the iconic landscapes of U.S. national parks in a way we had never seen them before.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Using a portable camera obscura he calls a tent camera, Morell made this image of Old Faithful while it was erupting. The image is essentially being projected onto the gravelly ground through a lens on top of the tent camera and being re-photographed. It is actually a simple antique process, though one that’s complicated to explain.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">The results took my breath away.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Old Faithful has been photographed since practically the invention of photography and by millions of tourists and professionals ever since. This image is a singularity; it is the captured moment of a timeless event, using an age-old technique to bring you something old yet new, magical, inexplicable, and beautiful.</span>

<br>
<span class="info-summary-p"><span class="summary-credit">Kurt Mutchler, Senior Editor, Science</span></span>

I have seen a lot of images from Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park, but nothing like Abelardo Morell’s. The commonplace becomes an abstract collage yet the geyser still clearly dominates the landscape. Photography is all about gear and technique, yet it’s nothing without vision. Morell has taken the simple physics of the tenth-century camera obscura and brought it into the 21st century.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p"><em>National Geographic’</em>s first image of Old Faithful appeared in the June 1912 issue with this caption: “In the 40 years that this geyser has been known to the white man, it has never failed to eject its graceful column of water at intervals of 65 minutes.” One hundred years later Morell captured the wonder of it all with his astute, graceful vision.</span>

I took this offer very seriously when I first started working here almost seven years ago. I thought of it kind of like a tattoo—you better like what you get because you're going to be stuck with it. So naturally, it took me almost three years before I finally settled on my first selection.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">It’s hard to pick one. I don’t have a favorite food, song, or movie, so how do you choose a favorite picture? When editing a magazine story, I look at every frame shot by the photographer and whittle down one by one. In much the same way, I approached this exercise by relooking at every image published in 2013 and then narrowed my selects until just a few remained.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">There’s a beautiful Abelardo Morell from Olympic National Park that I would love to hang on my wall. Sebastiao Salgado’s Siberian herders stand out because—well, he’s a master. I’m drawn to the subtle cinematic quality David Guttenfelder captured in a picture from North Korea of a woman standing next to a fish tank. Having worked with Ed Kashi on his northern Nigeria feature, I’m particularly moved by his depiction of women running on railroad tracks strewn with garbage.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Nick Nichols’s multiyear opus on lions is filled with iconic imagery. Yet, in the end, reflecting on the merits of each photograph—again and again—the most unusual, for me, is this scene of mating lions. Perhaps Nick’s passion for this project comes through and mirrors the ferocity portrayed. In any case, it’s unforgettable.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">When David Guttenfelder showed us the pictures he shot for “Last Song for Migrating Birds,” a story about how poachers coat tree branches with glue to trap migrating songbirds, I was horrified.</span>
 
<span class="info-summary-p">Who would want to eat a sweet little oriole? And how could there possibly be enough meat to make the effort worthwhile? It would be one thing if people need the birds to subsist, but that’s mostly not the case­­. These birds are considered delicacies that people pay a lot of money for.</span>
 
<span class="info-summary-p">So when David projected this image of a man with the wing of a blackcap in his lips, I braced myself for a gruesome story about how the man ate the bird live. Instead, David told us, the man was actually a conservationist sucking the sticky sap from the wings of a bird that had been stuck in a glue trap.</span>
 
<span class="info-summary-p">What at first glance looks like a moment of imminent violence and tragedy is actually a moment of incredible tenderness and hope. As with so many things, there is more than meets the eye in this picture.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Having worked with Diane Cook and Len Jenshel on several stories, the tumbleweeds story is a favorite of mine. The photograph of the two masked workers in California holding a compact car-size tumbleweed above their heads catches your eye and makes you smile. The men seem to be surrounded by dangerous tumbleweeds almost inching toward them. It also illustrates what an invasive problem the weeds have become.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">Standing as if waiting for signals from another world, these men on the Djibouti shores hope for a faint cell phone signal from neighboring Somalia.

We are all connected, or try to be.</span>

As it happens, I’ve worked with John Stanmeyer since his first ever story in <em>National Geographic</em>. And each story had an image that touched a hidden string in my soul. Years later, I still hear the sound. This picture from “To Walk the World” is one of them. It makes me want so much for everybody desperately trying to connect with others, to be heard and hear back from loved ones.</span>

<p class="info-summary"><span class="summary-credit">
Keith Jenkins, Director of Photography, Digital</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">I fell in love, on the opening spread, with the photo story on soccer in Africa by Jessica Hilltout. Young Orlando’s face, full of determination as he clutched his homemade soccer ball, reminded me of my own children, who I coached half a world away in suburban Virginia. Both of my boys struck similar poses for our youth soccer team photos—only they wore crisp blue jerseys and held perfect, regulation-size balls. All of their faces, Orlando’s and my two boys’, speak to their love of the game, but their means of expressing it are worlds apart.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">It is Jessica’s photo of the mini-goal in Burkina Faso that fascinates me the most, however, as it speaks to both the universal nature of the game as well as to the excess we take for granted here in the west. Can one enjoy this most special and universal of games playing on an overgrown field with a makeshift goal of sticks and cloth? Absolutely, these pictures say, and perhaps your enjoyment is even greater because by literally building your soccer match with your own hands you invest a bit more heart and soul in the process. I don’t see a broken-down goal when I look at this picture; rather I see the most pristine of altars to the game that lets us all be children again.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">I found many photographs from this story to be exquisite for their combination of vivid color and barren landscapes, of humor and harshness. The riveting gaze of this young girl, at once innocent and old beyond her years, draws me in. The contrast between her dead-center, sharp presence and the slightly out-of-focus, more candid air of the girl on the right reminds me this is a glimpse of everyday life in a remote and extreme corner of the world.</span>

Sherry Brukbacher, Assistant Photo Editor, Digital</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">When I was asked to participate in the casting of photo subjects for the Changing Faces story I was daunted to say the least. We needed multiracial subjects from all over the U.S., from every kind of community, for the photos to be accurately representative. We brainstormed for days to find the best way to locate our subjects. What it boiled down to was good old-fashioned research, phone calls, emails, and more phone calls.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">While scouring Facebook one day I came across this wonderful little angel’s face with platinum blond hair, green eyes smiling back at me. His profile was perfect for our story. After many emails and phone calls (and luck) I finally made direct contact with Tayden Burrell and his mother.</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">“Of course” they were willing to be photographed by Martin Schoeller for our story! Almost everyone we contacted had the same enthusiastic reaction. I was even luckier to have found myself in New York City the day Martin was photographing little Tayden. Not only was I fortunate enough to watch Martin in action, I had the chance to touch those golden locks on Tayden’s head—and it was just as wonderful as you’d imagine.<span class="info-credit">Photograph by Martin Schoeller, National Geographic</span><a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/changing-faces/funderburg-text" target="_blank" class="info-link">

<span class="info-summary-p">
The photographers of <em>National Geographic</em> come from all walks of life. Their pictures 

are proof of their passion. But beyond the images, these photographers are also our 

friends, our colleagues, our community. As part of our 125th anniversary special issue 

this October, we turned the camera around—on them.</span>

</span>

<span class="info-summary-p">
I sat down with 44 photographers this year at our headquarters to talk about how they

found photography, and why they never left. From my interviewer’s chair, it felt like

traveling to other worlds without moving an inch. We hope you’ll enjoy meeting these 

people—the makers of some of the most memorable images of our time—as much as we 

enjoy working with them every day.

Morell projected some of his first images onto the walls of rooms, explains Tom O’Neill in the October issue of <em>National Geographic</em>. “Now Morell himself has gone outdoors, using the ground, rough and intimate, as his backdrop.” The photographer set out to re-imagine some of the most well photographed vistas in national parks around the United States, including this image of Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.

The wind is furious; crops are impossible to grow. The temperature can drop below freezing 340 days a year. Many Kyrgyz have never seen a tree.”

Adaptation is a beautiful illustration of how living things learn from and grow with the world around them.”

</p><p class="info-summary">In April, Christie’s auction house in New York sold a letter for six million dollars. Written by biologist Francis Crick in 1953, it described his recent discovery of the structure of DNA to his 12-year-old son. National Geographic’s online article about the sale generated a lot of discussion about how biologist Rosalind Franklin, a contemporary of Crick’s, got cheated of her share of the credit for the discovery. Those comments prompted a look at other female researchers responsible for some of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in recent memory that were similarly snubbed or overlooked. “Over the centuries, female researchers have had to work as ‘volunteer’ faculty members, seen credit for significant discoveries they've made assigned to male colleagues, and been written out of textbooks,” writes Jane J. Lee.
