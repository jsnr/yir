This time it’s an understatement. Earlier this year Paul Salopek (seen here in Ethiopia’s Afar desert) embarked on a seven-year global trek, walking from Africa to Tierra del Fuego in the footsteps of our ancestors. Why? “For many reasons,” he writes in the December issue of <em>National Geographic</em>. “[T]o relearn the contours of our planet at the human pace of three miles an hour. To slow down. To think. To write. To render current events as a form of pilgrimage. I hope to repair certain important connections burned through by artificial speed, by inattentiveness. I walk, as everyone does, to see what lies ahead. I walk to remember.”

It’s important for waterfall kayakers to land precisely, an outcome influenced by their actions at the lip of the waterfall and into the first 20 feet of free fall. “At this moment,” explained Brandt, “I was focused on setting my angle correctly.” <a href="http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/extreme-photo-of-the-week/" class="info-link">

Maybe not. As National Geographic Daily News reported in May, some aviation historians now believe a German-born inventor named Gustave Whitehead—seen here with his daughter Rose—beat the brothers into the air by as much as three years. Though many experts disagree or remain dubious, an Australian flight historian named John Brown has convinced the aviation bible <em>Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft</em> that an enhanced photograph shows Whitehead flying his plane in Fairfield, Connecticut, on August 14, 1901. Which way this piece of history tilts remains up in the air.

</a><span class="info-credit">Photograph from Corbis</span></p></li><li><p class="info-headline">Extreme Kayaker</p><p class="info-summary">A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, <em>National Geographic</em> magazine ran a yearlong series profiling explorers like Trip Jennings (pictured here), a conservationist who in 2008 made the first descent of the notoriously turbulent lower Congo River. Traveling by kayak, foot, motorbike, and plane to document the world’s unspoiled place, Jennings fits National Geographic’s definition of a true risk-taker. <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/125-exploration/risk-takers-gallery" class="info-link">

In December 1912, at the age of 30, he led a 31-man team across an uncharted 2,000-mile-long swath of Antarctica in pursuit of scientific knowledge: biological, geological, meteorological, atmospheric, magnetic, and glaciological. David Roberts’s feature story in the January issue of National Geographic—with photos by Frank Hurley, including this one of expedition meteorologist Cecil Thomas Madigan’s frost-covered face—tells one of the most terrifying survival stories of all time.

Today loose regulations and a boom in commercial climbing have made the 29,035-foot-tall Mount Everest accessible to anyone who can afford to pay the price. As hundreds of people try to climb it every year—and more than half succeed, as this graphic shows—the peak is being ruined with garbage and waste. At the same time, say professional climbers, the experience itself is being ruined by the glut of visitors. “The most dangerous thing about Everest,” says one guide, “is everyone else who’s trying to climb it.” Mark Jenkins’s story in the June issue of National Geographic examines how Everest has become an icon of everything that’s wrong with climbing.

Another way is to watch this accompanying video, which offers an up-close look at the cold hostility of Queen Maud Land and the unique challenges faced by these devoted climbers. As photographer Cory Richards says: “You definitely have to work for everything in Antarctica. Nothing is a given; you have to earn it.”

For some brave souls today, BASE jumping—where people leap from fixed objects (“BASE” is an acronym for “building, antenna, span, cliff”) and use a parachute to control their fall—comes pretty close. This shot, taken in Italy by Stela Prodanovic, was a winning entry in the Your Shot “Travelogue” category.

Hannah Bloch takes up this existential question in the September issue of National Geographic, examining the necessary flip side of success. “Failure,” writes Bloch, “is the specter that hovers over every attempt at exploration. Yet without the sting of failure to spur us to reassess and rethink, progress would be impossible.” Famous failures abound, including that of explorer Robert Peary, seen here in 1909 peering over Arctic ice on his third try to reach the North Pole. “Even at their most miserable,” writes Bloch, “failures provide information to help us do things differently next time." <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/famous-failures/bloch-text" class="info-link">

One of them is Devils Tower, a 5,114-foot-tall igneous monolith in the Black Hills—“the skyscraper of the Wyoming plains,” writes Mark Jenkins in National Geographic Traveler. Formed 50 million to 60 million years ago, it’s now a U.S. national monument. In this shot Jenkins scales Devils Tower, a holy place for many Native American tribes, who call it Mato Tilapo, or Bear Lodge. The National Park Service discourages climbing during the month of June, out of respect for the number of Native American ceremonies that occur then.

By one estimate, more than 99 percent of Afghanistan’s archaeological sites have been looted, items stolen by farmers enriched by the high value of rare antiquities. National Geographic Daily News went digging with several looters to get an inside look at the country’s historic artifacts and how people avoid arrest for breaking the law.

Fortunately for archaeologists and anthropologists, the icy conditions preserved him extremely well—so well that five millennia later, he’s still being analyzed in an Italian lab for clues about human origins and evolution. In October, National Geographic’s Onward team visited Ötzi and the site where he died.

For decades industrial pollutants—insecticides, fungicides, organochlorides, and DDT—leached into rivers there, and by the late 1970s the British otter population had all but collapsed. The mammals also went extinct in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and in most of France, Germany, and Italy as well. But as chemical bans slowly took effect, writes Adam Nicolson in the February issue of National Geographic magazine, “the population started to climb back toward health.” By 2010 nearly 60 percent of English riverbanks were occupied by otters. Today “only the London area and some northern industrial cities remain otter-free.”

But if you really want to get up close and personal with the Vumbi pride, dip into this interactive online feature. Photographer Michael “Nick” Nichols and videographer Nathan Williamson made several extended trips to the Serengeti between July 2011 and January 2013. Using high-tech tools—cameras mounted on a remote-control toy car and a rugged robot tank, night-vision cameras and goggles—as well as old-fashioned, camera-in-hand technology, Nichols shot 242,000 images (including this one of a male named C-Boy mating with a female in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park), and Williamson recorded 200 hours of video. The result is a multimedia presentation you have to see—and hear—to believe.

</p><p class="info-summary">“Cassowaries are large, flightless birds related to emus and (more distantly) to ostriches, rheas, and kiwis,” writes Olivia Judson in the September issue of National Geographic magazine. How large? People-size: Adult males stand well over five foot five and top 110 pounds. Females are even taller, and can weigh more than 160 pounds. Dangerous when roused, they’re shy and peaceable when left alone. But even birds this big and tough are prey to habitat loss. The dense New Guinea and Australia rain forests where they live have dwindled. Today cassowaries might number 1,500 to 2,000. And because they help shape those same forests—by moving seeds from one place to another—“if they vanish,” Judson writes, “the structure of the forest would gradually change” too. <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/cassowaries/judson-text" class="info-link">

But that splendid isolation, writes Hampton Sides in the May issue of National Geographic magazine, “has led to an astonishing abundance of life,” past and present. Paleontologists say it’s the last place where woolly mammoths lived. Today it’s home to snowy owls, muskoxen, arctic foxes (like this pup playing with a lemming carcass), reindeers, and the largest population of Pacific walruses. It also serves as the world’s biggest denning ground for polar bears. This photo gallery of its current residents merely flicks at the island’s biodiversity.

Their numbers dropped alarmingly.” But “a Brazilian government crackdown on poaching and a 1992 global ban on the trade of wild crocodilian skins eased the pressure on the beleaguered yacare population. The crocs themselves did the rest. After a string of intense rainy seasons—ideal for breeding—caiman numbers rebounded dramatically. As many as ten million yacare caimans are estimated to live in the wetlands today.”

Funded by the National Geographic Expeditions Council, the Cape York Biodiversity Expedition was led by Harvard University researcher and National Geographic photographer Tim Laman. “What's really exciting about this expedition,” Laman told National Geographic Daily News, “is that in a place like Australia, which people think is fairly well explored, there are still places like Cape Melville where there are all these species to discover. There's still a big world out there to explore.”

</p><p class="info-summary">A lot has changed since 1888, when National Geographic was founded. But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, National Geographic magazine ran a yearlong series profiling explorers like Jaroslav Flegr (pictured here), a Czech evolutionary biologist who theorized that Toxoplasma gondii—a common parasite that lives and reproduces in cats—is infecting humans and adversely controlling our brains. By risking his health and reputation to help others, Flegr fits National Geographic’s definition of a true risk-taker.

Scientists working with a related species in Japan point to genetics over environmental factors. Meantime, recent mating trials in New Orleans have posited green as a recessive trait—good camouflage just makes them fittest for survival. Meaning it’s easier being green.

The killing is substantially indiscriminate, with heavy impact on species already battered by destruction or fragmentation of their breeding habitat. Mediterraneans shoot cranes, storks, and large raptors for which governments to the north have multimillion-euro conservation projects. All across Europe bird populations are in steep decline, and the slaughter in the Mediterranean is one of the causes.” Franzen’s eye-opening article is accompanied by David Guttenfelder’s affecting photographs. In this one, a songbird rescuer in Cyprus uses his saliva to remove sticky plum tree sap from a blackcap’s feather and feet, so that the bird can safely fly when released.

Each year these 40,000 indigenous reindeer herders—“the real cowboys of Siberia”—make an epic journey across the frozen tundra, driving their flocks hundreds of miles to grazing land and back again. This man’s trek was captured by Sebastião Salgado for Genesis, a new book of black-and-white photos documenting the world’s still pristine places, shot in 32 countries over eight years. Excerpts of Salgado’s haunting work were published this October in Visions of Earth, a trio of images that appear in each issue of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine and reveal the richness and variety of life on our planet. <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/visions-of-earth/visions-earth-2013#/1013-reindeer-herders-670.jpg" class="info-link">

The answer used to be more black and white. But today more and more people are of mixed heritage. In the 2000 census, when a multiple-race option appeared for the first time, 6.8 million Americans checked it off. Ten years later that number grew by 32 percent. The quickly changing fabric of our country—where familiar racial categories are being joined by new ones rooted in self-determined identity—provides an opportunity to re-examine our definitions and assumptions. It’s also a chance to gaze at a gallery of intriguing faces and features, photographed by Martin Schoeller.

</p><p class="info-summary">Libya has been a recent flashpoint of global conflict and foreign policy debate. In 2011 civil war engulfed the North African country, prompting a NATO-led military intervention that ended Muammar Qaddafi’s life and long dictatorship. In 2013, Robert Draper’s February cover story in National Geographic magazine looked at how Qaddafi’s “warped vision” and “tangled philosophy” twisted Libya’s connection to its own rich history, neglecting cultural and archaeological treasures from Cyrene in the east to Sabratah in the west. Yet the story also looked forward, optimistically, to a post-conflict country and the challenge its citizens face in forging a new identity (re)attached to their past.

Even pre–high school students feel pressure to physically alter themselves in pursuit of a fantasy ideal. Photographer and artist Ji Yeo’s Beauty Recovery Room project visualizes this disturbing cultural trend in an October 2013 edition of PROOF, National Geographic’s new online destination for readers seeking a behind-the-scenes look at the storytelling process and a forum for conversations on photography, art, and journalism. Yeo’s series “uses the wounded faces and bodies of women who have recently undergone plastic surgery to show the physical cost of social pressure in Korea. Going under the knife, enduring bruises, scars, and being under general anesthetic several times are no longer considered risky or extravagant. They have all had multiple procedures and have plans for future augmentation. The photos were taken directly after their operation, while they were resting and waiting to be healed.”

Once upon a time you needed talent, training, and technical savvy to take a great picture, plus high-end equipment and the money to buy it. Today all you need is a smart phone with a camera app. People are taking—and sharing, and saving—more photos than they ever have before. It’s a revolution both aesthetic (filters make saturation and faux-vintage tones easy) and political (democratizing photography can encourage actual democracy, as citizen journalists in Tehran and Taksim Square showed). As these pictures—shots of everyday life in Africa, on an Instagram feed—make clear, the digital age is creating a world simultaneously bigger and smaller.

But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, National Geographic magazine ran a yearlong series profiling explorers like Lale Labuko (pictured here), an Ethiopian man working to end his Omo Valley tribe’s custom of killing children believed to be cursed (because they were born out of wedlock, or for other reasons). By risking his own life to rescue those of others, Labuko fits National Geographic’s definition of a true risk-taker.

From the beginning of December till Easter, festivals across the continent celebrate harvests and solstices, rites of passage and superstitions. Though most are tied to Christian holidays, many feature pre-Christian rituals—a “tribal Europe” where men cavort in costumes that blur the lines separating human and animal, civilization and wilderness, death and rebirth. A gallery of Charles Fréger’s photographs, from a story in the April National Geographic, show how these wild men, in full regalia, represent the complicated relationship human communities still have with nature.

The crops we depend on for survival—corn, wheat, and rice—are grown using a hundred million tons of the stuff each year. But its toll on water, air, and wildlife is steep. As Dan Charles writes in the May issue of National Geographic, “runaway nitrogen is suffocating lakes and estuaries, contaminating groundwater, and even warming the globe’s climate. As a hungry world looks ahead to billions more mouths needing nitrogen-rich protein, how much clean water and air will survive our demand for fertile fields?”

As Tim Folger writes in the September cover story of National Geographic magazine, “A profoundly altered planet is what our fossil-fuel-driven civilization is creating, a planet where Sandy-scale flooding will become more common and more destructive for the world’s coastal cities. By releasing carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, we have warmed the Earth by more than a full degree Fahrenheit over the past century and raised sea level by about eight inches. … [S]cientists are still uncertain about how fast and how high seas will rise.” This chart shows NOAA’s four possible scenarios for the year 2100.

By the late 1990s CFC production had all but stopped, making modern spray cans ozone-safe. Though scientists say the ozone layer won’t return to pre-1980s levels till after 2050, the amount of CFC in the atmosphere is steadily waning. It’s a start.

In the October issue of National Geographic, writer Jeffrey Gettleman and photographer Ed Kashi reported on the bloody business of conflict minerals—and on whether a budding campaign to stop companies from using ill-gotten resources will make a difference.

</p><p class="info-summary">Fifty years ago 200 fishing boats went out every summer into Norway’s coastal waters to harpoon whales for meat, bringing wealth to the small villages in the Lofoton Islands above the Arctic Circle. Today only 20 whaleboats go out on the hunt, as the children and grandchildren of whalers leave the remote communities to seek new pursuits. A June feature in National Geographic reports on the demise of the traditional whaling industry and the approaching end to a hardy way of life.

But even as the number of lions continues to decline rapidly in Africa, their interactions with people have increased as farms, hunting preserves, and other development encroach on wilderness. Brett Stirton’s images for an August feature in National Geographic reveal how both lions and humans suffer when home territories collide.

All kinds of found items, from torn shoes and empty water bottles to a dropped rosary, help him record the human story of the hundreds of thousands of persons who cross the Mexican border every year to illegally enter the United States. Cataloging the discarded possessions of migrants is “archaeology of 10 minutes ago,” De León says in a June posting by Virginia Hughes in National Geographic’s Phenomena blog. Her story helps flesh out De León’s Undocumented Migration Project, for which he has interviewed hundreds of desperate border crossers.

Its citizens cannot travel or speak to foreigners without permission. Propaganda clouds what is real and what is not. In July’s eye-opening story in National Geographic, writer Tim Sullivan and photographer David Guttenfelder used their access as journalists for the Associated Press to move around the country and peer beyond the facade. “We’ve traveled to collective farms, attended countless political rallies, and visited Pyongyang hot spots like the Gold Lane bowling alley,” writes Sullivan, “where the capital’s elite hoist battered balls made in America.”

The latest threat to the fragile democracy is Islamic extremism. Terrorist attacks by Boko Haram, a separatist group, and harsh retaliation by the military have created a state of terror across northern Nigeria.

The tiny invertebrates can survive in both low- and high-pressure environments, and in temperatures as low as -328ºF (-200ºC) and as high as 304ºF (151ºC). But these millimeter-long, multicelled organisms have always been too elusively small to sit for a portrait. This year, however, German scientists used an electron microscope to make a high-resolution photograph of a single tardigrade—revealing a creature that resembles both a bear and a piglet. This image was published in July’s Visions of Earth, a trio of photos that appear in each issue of National Geographic.

Wood from when the instruments were made grew during a uniquely cold period: 1645 to 1715. Long winters during that time created low density in the wood, which helps create a richer sound for a violin. Stradivarius violins, named after the family that made them, can’t be re-created. But a Swiss researcher uncovered how to make similar wood that can create an indistinguishable sound. The secret? A fungus that changes how wood grows, detailed in the April edition of National Geographic.

They haven’t vanished. In fact … in the conversation of certain dreamer-nerds, especially outside NASA, you can now hear echoes of the old aspiration and adventurousness—of the old craziness for space.” That old craziness appears on the cover itself, where Stephan Martiniere’s art shows a 22nd-century dream: an unmanned probe powered by nuclear fusion exploring a new solar system, after traveling several decades from Earth at 100 million miles an hour.

But at least one thing is the same: Exploration is the heart of what we do, and risk is part and parcel of exploration. Modernity and technology can remove only so much danger and uncertainty. As long as people keep pushing limits—physical, political, scientific, financial—they are taking risks. To celebrate that questing spirit, National Geographic magazine ran a yearlong series profiling explorers like Sunita Williams (pictured here), an astronaut who’s spent 322 days in space and 50 hours walking in space—the most spacewalking of any female astronaut. By risking her life to help pioneer a new human endeavor, Williams fits National Geographic’s definition of a true risk-taker.

When photographers have a technical problem—like how to house an underwater camera or control a car remotely—Boggs crafts a solution, from sketched prototype to finished product. And he does it without a kit or directions. This video on Proof, our new online photography experience, offers a glimpse of Boggs at work.

No vehicle existed that could survive the crushing pressure at 36,000 feet. So Cameron decided to build one himself. After seven years researching, designing, and testing a harmonica-shaped submersible called DEEPSEA CHALLENGER, it was time to put the craft to the test. Bruce Barcott’s story from June, first published in the iPad edition of National Geographic, takes you behind the scenes.

Essentially, it's a way of focusing light through a small opening onto a dark surface. Morell projected some of his first images onto the walls of rooms, explains Tom O'Neill in the October issue of National Geographic. "Now Morell himself has gone outdoors, using the ground, rough and intimate, as his backdrop." The photographer set out to re-imagine some of the most well photographed vistas in national parks around the United States, including this image of Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.

The Pomeranian region is also known for Slowinski National Park—part of the UNESCO list of World Biosphere Reserves—which contains sand dunes that can tower 138 feet above sea level.

"A night garden invites reflection," writes Cathy Newman. "Unlike the sun, the moon welcomes our gaze. We can wax poetic, wane with melancholy—howl, even—and admire the wonder of an obverse world where plants reach out, not to sunlight but to the faint glow flung to Earth by a diadem of stars."

These Kyrgyz nomads eke out a living in a high-altitude area they refer to as the "roof of the world." That may sound romantic, but "it's also an environment at the very cusp of human survivability," writes Michael Finkel in the February issue of <em>National Geographic</em>. "Much of it is above 14,000 feet. The wind is furious; crops are impossible to grow. The temperature can drop below freezing 340 days a year. Many Kyrgyz have never seen a tree."

"Abu Dhabi may be increasingly educated, affluent, and cosmopolitan, but beneath lies a culture of the desert and the tent," writes Carl Hoffman.

CALCIFIED SWALLOW, LAKE NATRON, 2012
 
The notion of portraits of dead animals in the place where they once lived is what also drew me to photographing the creatures in the Calcified series:

I unexpectedly found the creatures - all manner of birds and bats - washed up along the shoreline of Lake Natron in Northern Tanzania. No-one knows for certain exactly how they die, but it appears that the extreme reflective nature of the lake’s surface confuses them, causing them to crash into the lake. The water has an extremely high soda and salt content, so high that it would strip the ink off my Kodak film boxes within a few seconds. The soda and salt causes the creatures to calcify, perfectly preserved, as they dry. 

I took these creatures as I found them on the shoreline, and then placed them in ‘living’ positions, bringing them back to ‘life’, as it were. Reanimated, alive again in death.<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/pictures/131003-calcified-birds-bats-africa-lake-natron-tanzania-animals-science/" class="info-link">
